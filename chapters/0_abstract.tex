%Video streaming over the public Internet has become a hot topic in recent years, with video traffic now accounting for more than 50\% of the total Internet traffic. In live streaming, one of the main challenges is latency

%We then propose a new approach to improve the live streaming user experience, which is the objective of this thesis. We first develop a textbftestbed for experimenting with HTTP-based live streaming protocols. Then, we use the testbed to evaluate the performance of existing streaming protocols such as HLS and DASH with different configurations and HTTP versions. The experimental results show that this solution almost eliminates video playback stalls, providing smooth playback of the audio track even when the video could not be loaded.
