Video streaming over the Internet has become increasingly popular in recent years and now accounts for more than 50\% of total traffic. One of the main challenges video developers have to tackle is providing a user experience that is as smooth as possible. In live video streaming, low-latency in particular, the problem is especially challenging and requires finding a trade-off between reducing the probability of video freezes (rebuffering) and keeping a high video quality.

In this thesis, we first develop a testbed to evaluate the performance of adaptive bitrate video streaming technologies. We then run some emulations and experiment with real-word network datasets to analyze how existing solutions behave. We find that some configurations show suboptimal behavior and propose some improvements based on that. The main proposed solution, which takes advantage of HTTP/3 features and modern browser APIs such as WebCodecs and WebAssembly, shows that it is possible to greatly reduce playback stalls and to provide a smooth playback experience with stable live latency, as the experimental results show.
